C:\Users\asara\AndroidStudioProjects\GPSReplay2\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:7: Error: Mock locations should only be requested in a test or debug-specific manifest file (typically src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml) [MockLocation]
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_MOCK_LOCATION"/>
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "MockLocation":
   Using a mock location provider (by requiring the permission
   android.permission.ACCESS_MOCK_LOCATION) should only be done in debug
   builds (or from tests). In Gradle projects, that means you should only
   request this permission in a test or debug source set specific manifest
   file.

   To fix this, create a new manifest file in the debug folder and move the
   <uses-permission> element there. A typical path to a debug manifest
   override file in a Gradle project is src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml.
